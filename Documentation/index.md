*** 

The Unity Gaze Interaction System is a lightweight plugin that enables gaze interaction in Unity projects, working for both VR and non-VR projects without requiring additional packages. Inspired by the [Unity XR Interaction Toolkit](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit@2.0/manual/index.html), this system utilizes an Interactor-Interactable approach for intuitive interaction design.

## Features

- **Gaze Distance**: Define minimum and maximum range for gaze interaction.
- **Activation Time**: Set dwell time required to activate objects with gaze.
- **Raycast Filtering**: Choose which object layers respond to gaze.
- **Visual Feedback**: Select the type of reticle displayed for user focus.
- **Gaze Events**: Trigger actions based on user gaze behavior (enter, stay, exit, activate, toggle).
